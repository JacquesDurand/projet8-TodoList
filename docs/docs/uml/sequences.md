# Sequences

Sequence diagrams are used to detail even further the interactions between
actors and systems during a use case, namely doing so by adding a notion
of temporality (event chronology)


We will not show here every sequence for each use case (for it is tedious, and
in our case, quite repetitive for just CRUD operations), but feel free
to get inspired by the example below, which is one of the most complex
use case of the application

### Example

Sequence diagram of the interactions when an **Administrator** tries to edit the
info of a **User**:
